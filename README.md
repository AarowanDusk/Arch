Unreal Engine 5 Architectural Visualization Project
Overview
This project is an architectural visualization experience built in Unreal Engine 5, where users can seamlessly explore a designed environment using an intuitive camera system. The project features C++-based architecture, allowing dynamic object placement, interaction, and full Blueprint conversion for flexibility.

Key Features
✅ Checkpoint Navigation System – Click anywhere to move to predefined checkpoints within the environment.
✅ Dual Camera Modes – Switch between an explore mode camera (free-roam) and a first-person view for an immersive experience.
✅ C++-Driven Objects & World – Every object and interaction is coded in C++, ensuring optimized performance and procedural scalability.
✅ Blueprint Compatibility – While the core logic is implemented in C++, all components and systems can be converted to Blueprints for easy customization.
✅ Architectural Focus – Designed for architectural visualization, making it ideal for real estate walkthroughs, interior design previews, and virtual experiences.
